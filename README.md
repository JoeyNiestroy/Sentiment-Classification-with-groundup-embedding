# Sentiment-Classification-with-groundup-embedding
Sentiment Classification model using twitter text corpus and skip gram embedding 
Prelabeled tweets dataset was obatained for kaggle, Pre_Processing.py reads in DF and and normalizes data through character removal, spell check, and lemminization. For ease of post processing changes each step is saved to a new column, all funcions moved to parallel and computing power was used through HPC system thanks to W&M. Sample_Generation.py creates and returns numpy arrays of positive and negative samples (negative samples at 5x rate) using skip-gram sampling, Unigram array was created using techniques from Word2Vec paper,due to issues with shared memory arrays this has yet to be moved parrell.
